The staff is amazing, kind, knowledgable and overall good people. The room not so great, office chair super dirty as pictured below the vents were super dusty. The only reason I looked was because my allergies were so agitated it had to be something in the room.  I travel with my hypoallergenic dog when we asked for a dog bed it came covered in dog hair. Mind you my dog doesn't shed and she refused to lay on that bed. Lastly No room service only breakfastI guess thats where it counts but was disappointing. " + System.lineSeparator() +

From our initial experience of arrival and dropping off our car to the valet (a very friendly gentlemen welcomed us and took care of the car quickly), to a pleasant gentlemen at the desk who answered all of our questions \u0026 checked us in quickly (we did have reservations for our 3 day stay), to other hotel staff who were all smiles and acknowledged us as we arrived and got our luggage to the elevator.  Beautiful room, great views of the waterfront and arriving and departing flight at SFO.\r\nSurprisingly quiet, giving the proximity to the airport.  Clean, spacious, and well-appointed comfy room.   Our experiences at Hangar Steak for both dinner and breakfast were wonderful.  Expertly prepared steaks (tried the filet.  Best I\u0027ve EVER eaten). My wife had the free-range chicken with root veggies.  She thought it was AMAZING.  Local produce was used, and it\u0027s SO fresh!!   The breakfast buffet was also beyond awesome.   Also, we appreciated having a dog relief station right out back for our service dog, complete with baggies.  All staff members ROCK!  Awesome folks, truly!
