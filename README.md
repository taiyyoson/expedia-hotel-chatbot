## Leveraging AI


After conceptualizing and building out/implementing my design first without the help of AI, I leveraged AI here and there to help flesh and clean out my design. I had a mostly working build initially, but below are the main points I leveraged AI for: 

- small amounts of research to understand building out a wordIndex data structure to help setup my findWord search method
    - **what I tried & what suggestions AI made:**
        - going through slides, old lectures, and code examples went over in class to understand word mapping 
        - AI suggested a whole new data class that acted as a review wrapper, such that I can find frequency and map it to reviews really easily without the need of extra data structures.


- help debugging test cases and cleaning up error handling/validation cases
    - **what I tried & what suggestions AI made:**
        - I debugged and fixed up most test cases. I only didn't understand the code logic behind the Professor's invalid queries, where I needed to throw certain exceptions instead of my primitve error handling.
        - AI helped me implement proper error handling.


- generating javadocs and ensuring my code styling was consistent throughout and followed the rubric for the whole project
    - **what I tried & what suggestions AI made:**
        - Writing javadocs takes forever...:P


## Future Implementation

- splitting up DataSearchMain more to delegate its responsibilities into a few more different classes/packages
- clean up code with more succinct methods where applicable. better code efficiency
- Possibly using interface logic for our main class - HotelReviewService?
