When I booked the room, breakfast was included but when we checked in I didn\u0027t get a coupon. I wasn\u0027t aware that to get a free breakfast you have to provide a coupon and the next morning had to deal with explaining the waiter that breakfast was included when we booked, he said he will take care of it but still included it on our room charge. At the end the charge was removed but I don\u0027t believe I have to deal with this. The person who checked us in the night before had to explain the process and provide the coupon.

We had to call the hotel on the courtesy phonr and then we had to wait another 30 mins for the driver to get all the way back to the to airport. We made tge mistake of waiting at the wrong covered bus stop area and when we saw the shuttle pass our station and slow down at the best one. But apparently, when the driver didn\u0027t see anyone directly under the bus stop, he didn\u0027t bother to even come to a full stop. He then just took off to other next terminal. Not happy with shuttle service the hotel provided but hotel staff was very pleasant and accomodating.",
