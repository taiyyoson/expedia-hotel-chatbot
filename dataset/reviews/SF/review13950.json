Next to it is a sign that says: $X/hour, $YY/day to even enter the lot.\r\n\r\nThe cost was higher before we even checked in.  That, to me, is RIDICULOUSLY deceptive.  It\u0027s located very close to the airport, with tightly controlled areas all about (razor wire) so it was about 4 blocks away when we found a parking spot, we timed it, an 11 minute walk away.  Took less time to drive to the airport than to get to our car from the hotel.\r\n\r\nIt was a mostly new facility.  Clean.  Nice colors and very refreshing design.  For the advertised price, it was an OK deal, and very conveniently located.  For the actual cost with parking, I would not have chosen it, it would be far above the acceptable price.\r\n\r\nThe staff was mostly clueless though: they didn\u0027t understand or even acknowledge or want to discuss there was a problem arriving to find out the rate was a full **ZZ% higher** than I\u0027d agreed.  They said, \"we allow a 15 minute grace period to check in, for free.\"  I did not see that on any sign when trying to enter, but that wasn\u0027t even the point.  You\u0027re trapped there and either pay the extra or park 4 blocks away.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve replaced all reference to the actual costs, percentages and prices with XX YY and ZZ, (per Expedia policy preventing reviews with prices).
